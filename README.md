## Project 2: Smashed Sums

Consult main.pl to load all the necessary files and libraries.
The board is a list that contains 3 lists: the 1st one is a list of row sums, the 2nd is a list of column sums and the 3rd is a list of lists containing all the cells of the board.
The function checkSums returns yes when all the rows and columns sums are equal to the values indicated in the first two lists.
