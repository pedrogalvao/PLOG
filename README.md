## TO DO:
- Function expand is not working correctly in all the cases
- Function choose_move is too simple and the game never ends with this kind of choice
- Function test only works for vertical and horizontal moves, it's necessary to consider diagonal
- Write function move(+Move, +Board, -NewBoard).
- Function value could consider opponent's positions
- Adapt all the functions to meet the specified requirements
- Finish Report
